Through the means of this website, the Architecture Student Council is now equipped with an open and public online system for communication, accountability, and record-keeping parallel to the one developed for and by the [Art Student Council](http://http://cooperasc.github.com/). A special thank-you to [Casey Gollan](http://cooperasc.github.com/people/casey-gollan/) for originally creating this system and happily sharing with us to use.
