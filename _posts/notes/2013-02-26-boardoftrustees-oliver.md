**THIS DOCUMENT IS PROVISIONAL. IT SHIFTS FROM SUMMARY MINUTES TO A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE CONVERSATION. IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO WE INTEND TO CREATE A SEPARATE SUMMARY AND A SEPARATE DETAILED RECORD. IT WAS A GREATER PRIORITY TO PUBLISH THIS IN ADVANCE OF THE BOARD FORUM THAN TO WAIT AFTERWARDS FOR TWO COMPLETE DOCUMENTS**.

*There has been an increasing frequency with which statements are contradictory, factually incorrect, and/or claimed to have been not made with regards to current discussion on matters of the Cooper Union. Therefore, it is the belief of the Architecture Student Council that all participants of this meeting must have their statements represented with the utmost accuracy and in their proper context – as a personal right to each party, for the health and validity of public discussion, and for the guarantee of accurate Council representation. Given this, the Architecture Student Council has chosen to provide (in the next day or two) a separate detailed record in addition to summary minutes of this meeting.*

-----------------------------------------------------
*[Meeting formally begins at 3:08 PM and runs about 2h30.]*

CASEY: [presents an agenda, a letter from Art Student Council regarding Early Decision deferral, and some art hometests.] I would like to start by talking about Early Decision deferral.

[Everyone reads agenda & letter]

EPSTEIN: [Gives financial history – nothing new and obtainable from other board meeting minutes.] Early Decision deferral was in no way punitive; purely a financial matter. All three schools initially developed plans and then Art School voted not to support them, so they are technically unsustainable. Trustees believe full scholarship is not the best asset; the students are the best asset. Praises the quality of the students through anecdote. Asks, would you rather give up the excellence of the institution, or give up a little bit of the scholarship?

CASEY: Lots of people see the scholarship as either something you fully award or don’t award at all.

EPSTEIN: All the Trustees want to preserve the full scholarship but it’s not attainable.

CASEY: It’s not attainable for this board. 

EPSTEIN: It hasn’t been attainable for the last four decades at least. Boards are made up of mostly Alumni that have the same interests in the School of Art that you do.

CASEY: If you don’t see the scholarship as the best asset then you don’t have the same interests we do.

RYAN: The scholarship preserves admission based solely on merit and not on an applicant’s finances. Wouldn’t charging even partial tuition change that?

EPSTEIN: Not in any way. It’s still merit-based admission, but probably over 50% of students have enough assets to be able to pay for school. Students of true need will still get a full scholarship. The scholarship reduction is only for those who can afford to pay.

 CASEY: We are not on the same page about the scholarship not being the best asset. Second, you say that the faculty turned an opportunity into a confrontation and Jamshed wanted to work together, but it seems to me like the same kind of strong-headed issue as when you say we’re on the same page but we’re not. Faculty was asked in the charge to come up with revenue-generating academic programs. 

EPSTEIN: They were asked to come up with revenue targets. 

CASEY: They were asked to create academic programs.

EPSTEIN: They were asked to create programs that matched revenue targets or to make cuts.

CASEY: They were asked to create academic programs, that were excellent, that generated revenue. Wanted to address that point, that it was the faculty that was offered this “opportunity”, and the faculty never wanted that “opportunity”, which is what they expressed in the letter. We felt the same way as students and it needs to be understood that it was an oppressive situation. You also said the three schools came to a board meeting and said they were on board, but the plans from all the schools reaffirmed the mission statement. But if you look at the other two schools, I don’t think it’s fair to say they’re on board with this. The Engineering faculty didn’t adopt or reject their plan and the Architecture plan was submitted without numbers. The Engineering plan also hinged on whether tuition was going to be charged or not so it could happen across all schools.

SHARANG: As Eng students we are in frequent contact and get updated by Dean Wolf, and were updated throughout the process as far as we could be, but this letter says “faculties of Architecture and Engineering also submitted risky and incomplete plans”. I disagree with that; I read through all the Engineering plans and they seemed completely clear to me and that our faculty did a lot of work and did the best job they could. Although there’s always risk in creating new programs it’s not the same as not submitting a plan or submitting something completely different, which the Art school did.

EPSTEIN: The school has a $60m budget and is losing $12m to $15m a year (depending on investment returns etc.). Every time endowment money is used, investment becomes that much more difficult. What’s YOUR solution?

CASEY: Faculty, Alumni, etc. have been considering what it would look like for Cooper to live within its means instead of trying to expand out of financial problems. Notion is that we are not properly capitalizing on the mission statement.

EPSTEIN: I don’t understand, what do you mean by capitalizing?

CASEY: You can raise money against the mission of the school.

EPSTEIN: How?

CASEY: It’s called philanthropy.

EPSTEIN: The general feeling in philanthropy is that everyone thinks this is a wonderful mission and it’s great as long as we can actually afford to maintain it. Alumni only donate 20%.

CASEY: I’ve heard a different number.

EPSTEIN: That’s because Drogin will say that we only have half the email addresses so it counts as 40%. No. Every school counts the number of alumni that gave, and then the number of alumni. We’re about 20% and there’s no fudging.

CASEY: I’ve heard disagreements and I don’t know who to trust about it. Part of this is that there’s a lot we’re not allowed to know and not a lot of granularity.

EPSTEIN: You have been given SO much granularity. The last 18 months TC and Jamshed have had a lot of meetings, and there was the webinar… Do you need to know how much each light bulb costs to burn in here?

CASEY: That’s kind of the level of accountability we’re talking about. When you say we need to round off numbers it’s not that there’s malfeasance, it’s just that it would make sense – 

EPSTEIN: Let’s go back. How do you solve the problem, and don’t tell me philanthropy, because the Art Faculty said the same thing, that we should just raise more money. Spoke with [???] and said that he just laughed, that a bunch of arts-based boards were told “just raise more money, raise more money” and the institutions closed.

CASEY: The next point is that I’ve heard the union is willing to negotiate on things that the Board is not willing to negotiate on.

EPSTEIN: You’re telling me that the Board is not willing to reduce benefits? Does it make sense to you that the Board is not willing to negotiate if the faculty are willing to give back something on their benefits? Does that make any sense to you or to anyone in this room? We had a meeting with the faculty a couple weeks ago and there was not a peep of this, it was just about the letter.

CASEY: I was at that meeting too and the faculty objected to your simplification of their position as “just raise more money”. Realistically we have a different view of what the school’s core asset is. You said “I don’t know what to go back to the board with if you’re just going to say “raise more money””.

RYAN: The capital campaign was to raise more money for that building?

EPSTEIN: It was about $60m raised for that building and other things as well. 

RYAN: I’m curious as to why you couldn’t raise that amount or something close to it with the new context of urgent need?

EPSTEIN: You have to think about fundraising. This is not a Cooper thing; it’s a fundraising thing. People give you money because they have a goal. To get a building named after them, to get their name on a plaque.

DE MENIL: Well ostensibly, you know, people’s motivation would be not so self-interested, but rather to give money to a school because they believe in a school, or to a symphony or a museum because they think the work that symphony or museum is good… You develop relationships over time and eventually if you’re fortunate.. Traditionally Cooper has not been successful in getting large donations. It’s a function of the composition of the board, of the development effort in general. Not so many years ago there was a new development director, and it’s a highly specialized job that involves a lot of effort and a very specific type of work. Presently we don’t have those “people that we know”; I’m sure you’ve heard the story that when the President asked the Mayor, the Mayor said “charge tuition, as much as you can”. As Mark explained, there’s a problem people have with contributing money to a school like this when there are families that can afford to play. It’s a long distance from the origins when perhaps the greatest percentage of the student body couldn’t pay. The environment has changed significantly. But there aren’t the funds anymore. It’s fine to say “let’s reimagine”, but practically speaking, what would your reimagination be?

ZULAIKHA: I’d like to shift the conversation because to ask a group of students with a very cursory knowledge might not be valuable. I can, at least, speak on behalf of Arch school in terms of what we do value, why, and what our fears are. One of the cornerstones of the Arch school is that the pedagogy is insulated from market trends, which preserves the principle of merit. How can you be sure that merit stays if you remove the scholarship, then? And how do you define what need-based is? 

EPSTEIN: You’re strengthening my case by saying you don’t have financial experience. How can I expect this group with no financial experience to comment and judge on decisions made by a Board full of experts on this kind of thing?

ZULAIKHA: I understand, but I don’t know if you understand how much we value the things that we currently have, and I would like to go through them. One of the things that has come up over and over again in the Architecture school is that the school is an oasis away from class hierarchies because of the meritocracy. On that basis the architecture school can accept a year of students and give them the best learning environment for each other. Another is that it insulates the program from having to sacrifice its academic integrity in order to align to market trends in order to procure outside funding. Also, the world “entitlement” has been thrown around rather recklessly. At least in our experience in the Arch school, you are fully accountable for the gift that you receive and if you can’t meet the academic standards of that accountability, you’re gone, if not within a semester, within a year.

OLIVER: And we’ve lost a bunch of people.

ZULAIKHA: Despite their greatest efforts to do otherwise, they just couldn’t handle the standards that are made possible here.

OLIVER: That’s the basis on which they earn or lose their right to be part of this social-intellectual body of students.

CHE: And I’d like to bring it back to the governance of the school, because there’s a group of students and faculty that form the Academic Standards Committee, and each year, if a student can’t meet the standards and can’t provide a legitimate reason for not doing so, they have to repeat a year or sometimes not come back again. The idea is that it’s only reliant on that, and not on any outside corporate influences on the school.

ZULAIKHA: And regarding “entitlement”, again, it still comes as a great cost to live here. Just the living expenses in New York rival what you would pay to go at another school. That’s not why people come here, and it’s not the reason people are demanding “free education”. It’s for all the other reasons – meritocracy, an open community of learning, and other things we can go on and on about but we know they won’t remain intact if that aspect is not kept. 

EPSTEIN: The question still remains, then, how do we sustain the school? You have to pay rent where you’re living, and for some reason you don’t have the financial wherewithal to figure out how to pay your rent... that’s what we’re dealing with here. It’s a really difficult year and we have to bring in money to pay our bills.


ZULAIKHA: But you have a group of students who really value what they have.

EPSTEIN: We value what they have.

ZULAIKHA: Mm….

EPSTEIN: The bottom line is how do you go forward when you don’t have enough money to do it.

ZULAIKHA: As a student body I know we can provide reasons for why this place is priceless and should remain so. For a place as unique as Cooper I don’t think the normal routes of acquiring philanthropic funds would really apply here, saying it timidly since I’m not that familiar. But I think there are ways to preserve the value of Cooper Union and express that in terms other than the dollar.

EPSTEIN: Something like that was raised before. I’ve been involved with the Phonathon. Nobody wants to help, talk about entitlement. In November, I was talking to a student and asked, “Why not give back to a school where you just got a $150,000 education? Why not give back? Don’t you feel something?”, and the student says, “If I have to pay for it it’s a student loan.”

ZULAIKHA: There are multiple definitions for the word “entitlement”: “the fact of having a right to something”, and “deserving of certain privileges”. I think I addressed that comment before, at least in the Architecture school and the people I know from other schools, it’s not entitlement; it’s a gift. And they understand the responsibility that comes with the privilege.

EPSTEIN: To be honest with you I don’t see a lot of that. I see some of it, but most don’t express that. They think they “earned” it, that’s the expression they use, and they don’t think they should help other generations have it.

ZULAIKHA: If you came through our studio right now and ask every student in our studio if they feel like they’re some pompous Cooper student or if they’re struggling to uphold the gift, it would be the latter. So the tomato tomahto conversation isn’t really productive. We can tell you what we value, how we value it, give suggestions about where we don’t think some of the suggestions by the board are really going to pan out. We’re already mourning the impending death of a really wonderful community we have down on the 3rd floor. That’s the most we can express to you, and we know that it’ll be irreparably changed once – 

EPSTEIN: There’s an Engineering school that started off completely free. After a few years they found out they couldn’t afford it so they changed it to a 50% scholarship, so $20,000 a semester. The President said the net effect of that was a 1 year blip and after that they were back to normal.

CASEY: I spoke to a faculty member from that school and went to a presentation by them. I’ve heard the “net effect” brought up over and over again and it’s different than what Zulaikha’s saying. It’s not a net effect; it’s something that there’s probably a way to measure and it’s not being measured. We’re using the wrong metrics. 

EPSTEIN: I’m not going to dispute anything you said because I agree with you. But we can’t afford it anymore, and we’re trying to find a way to make it as affordable as possible. 

ZULAIKHA: But if there are other institutions have followed things like this and gone through similar changes it would be really important to look at those and see what the effects were, both monetarily and academically.

EPSTEIN: [The aforementioned school] is the only real comparable since Cooper is unique, and it’s the only other one that started at a full scholarship.

ZULAIKHA: I don’t think anyone here is doubting the financial difficulties of the school in any way, or trying to deride the Board. But knowing that we have limited knowledge, and wanting to see things as clearly as possible, monetarily, to see how such a structure would operate, and what that would do – and how that would still ensure that the high standards of merit in the school would be absolutely preserved. I can speak at least for the Architecture school – and we’re not as vocal as perhaps the Art school, who we are very appreciative of most of the time – this is the kind of growing seed of resentment and mistrust. If you can’t specify what effects these changes will have on the institution, people aren’t really going to buy it and it’s come to a point where we feel powerless because if we don’t have financial knowledge and we aren’t privy to the contents of the BoT meetings, then why should we believe anything at all if we know that the biggest thing to lose is what we value?

EPSTEIN: There are Alumni trustees. There is a system of checks and balances.

CASEY: That’s not good enough and I don’t see a reason for not having faculty and student representatives on the Board. There are examples of private and public colleges that do have faculties on the board. Same with student representatives, and a petition from the Cooper students that, as of January, has 434 signatures. When you think about the size of the school.. The reasons for thee things have never been given and they’re getting less and less defensible.

RYAN: What are the board’s reasons for not having faculty members on the board?

EPSTEIN: We talk about a lot of confidential things.

RYAN: Like union issues?

EPSTEIN: Union issues are one of them. They wouldn’t let a trustee member sit in on union meetings. Go ask them. It’s just, things are discussed, and shouldn’t get out before decisions are made..

CASEY: Our student council has been looking at how there isn’t very much transparency from the top. We’ve been posting all of our meeting notes online.. The New York Times picked them up and the Attorney General – you mentioned his name earlier – and you said that basically if we don’t come up with enough money we’ll be in a situation to close.

EPSTEIN: Who said that?

CASEY: You did. 

EPSTEIN: I never said the Attorney General… 

DE MENIL: What he said was that there’s a restricted portion of the endowment and in order to invade the restricted portion of the endowment 

RYAN: As you said, if you can’t pay your rent..

EPSTEIN: Well that means you go into the corpus of the endowment.

CASEY: The Attorney General says he did not make that comment.

CACCIATORE: I think that was just an error in the quote-unquote “minutes”.

CASEY: That kind of offhand remark scares me…

EPSTEIN: There’s a certain truth to that. If they determine that we’ve been irresponsible with the money, they can close you down, the same way the FDIC can close a bank down because they’re being irresponsible with money. Attorney General’s Charities office has the power to close the institution.

CACCIATORE: It was just taken out of context.

CASEY: Most people are actually very calm, collected, involved, excited. Why don’t you let them in? It’s when they’re actively kept out that any sort of hostility brews.

EPSTEIN: Let me ask you a question. Aside from their personal glorification, why do you think someone would want to be on the board? What do you expect a student to do on the board?

CASEY: Like Zulaikha’s point, I think they would be able to properly articulate the values of the school, since I haven’t heard the administration or the trustees do that sufficiently, and we spoke before about how we have a gap in our understandings.

EPSTEIN: We don’t disagree with what you value; we value it more so. We just can’t afford it. To cut the budget by a third and “live within our means” is just not going to work. 

RYAN: “It wouldn’t work”? Are you saying it’s not possible?

EPSTEIN: It’s possible. You could have one student and one teacher salary. How much do you want to cut that?

CASEY: You hire outside consultants and then make an offhand remark when someone brings up living within our means?

EPSTEIN: No matter what we do, someone always tries to chop us down. This is the experience that we’ve had. Any step we take, there are people on the opposition side that is chopping it apart, and we’re between a rock and a hard place. Whatever we do, someone’s going to find a reason to shut down that and shut down the other thing. We did that, we should’ve done this. So we’re doing what we think is the best thing to do.

RYAN: But I’m saying, financially, would it work? Or is that just a language of saying that you don’t want it.

DE MENIL: It’s very complicated. In other words, if you reduce the student body, you reduce the faculty. It’s easy to reduce the student body – you just don’t let in so many students. Reducing the faculty involves documents issued that the Labor Relations Board gets involved in. It’s not so easy to take any of the schools and reduce them by a third. It’s easy to say, and it’s conceivable but you could reduce the school to much smaller than it is, and it might be able to work, but it involves such a vast and complete restructuring of everything that goes on here…

RYAN: It would be a “reinvention”.


DE MENIL: It would be a reinvention, but I’m not sure how – 

EPSTEIN: You’ve also got tenure. You can’t just cut tenure.

RYAN: Basically I’m just asking because the board of trustees and the administration wanted to have this conversation about revenue-generating academic programs. But I’m just wondering why there hasn’t been a conversation about what it would look like to cut the school down by a third.

EPSTEIN: There hasn’t been a really heavy duty study on that because nobody really thinks that’s a viable solution.

CASEY: But I think that’s what the faculty are advocating right now and a lot of people I’ve talked to. 


MICHAEL: In the Engineering school, we looked at what it would look like to cut a third of the Engineering school, on the Revenue Task Force last year, not just because of union issues, but because each department is already so small that you can’t cut each department by a third and still be able to teach a diversity of courses and such. You would need to cut an entire major. And nobody really wants to do that. Once you start teaching just mechanical engineering, it’s just not the same as an Engineering school.

EPSTEIN: It’s not just thinking about what you can cut now. How are you going to attract the next generation of… how are you going to hire great new educators? You have to think about new faculty, not just how you’re going to preserve… 

ZULAIKHA: The respect that this place maintains, at least among academic professionals remains as high as it’s always been.

EPSTEIN: To expect to be able to keep the faculty high while reducing expenses… I just, I don’t even… 

ZULAIKHA: They’re experiencing it everywhere else. The other thing is that all the he-said-she-said and all the circumstantial, speculative stuff is another example of why it’s difficult to feel that engaged in the process. For instance, Casey’s very good at keeping everything public and educated and structured, with the website and all that, but it doesn’t necessarily seem as though it’s coming as well from the other side.  If there are things that are confidential and we’re not privy to, as adults, we understand that, then what is the maximum amount of information we are privy to, and how can that be broken down so that we’re part of the community and it doesn’t come from asking, but instead –

EPSTEIN: Assuming you had a student on the Trustees, what do you expect that student to accomplish? Other than the edification of that person?

ZULAIKHA: I personally never supported a student just sitting in the meetings because I’m not certain what they would be privy to or whether that would actually change anything. But that’s because I have no knowledge of the activities of the Board of Trustees. It would be nice, maybe to have a seminar or something to understand how these things work instead of trying to pick apart the Attorney General comment and use third-hand knowledge.

EPSTEIN: There’s no secret; it’s like any Board of Trustees of any college of any kind. We sit around a table, try to hash it out, find a solution.

CASEY: If there’s no secret, then why is there a secret?

EPSTEIN: Because everything is discussed. Every option is discussed. Nothing is off the table. There are some things that we don’t like to have to look at, but we’d be irresponsible if we didn’t. If there was a student there, he wouldn’t be able to discuss those things with any other student. So what is the purpose of wanting a student on the board? The school is unsustainable, and no one’s telling us how to solve that problem to maintain – 

OLIVER: I’d actually like to follow up on that. I don’t see this issue as one being of transparency qua culpability, but rather, to list some examples – when the charge was displaced to the faculty of the schools to come up with the revenue generating programs, there was never any form of liaison or regular meetings with the faculty and the board, and there were no meetings afterwards to acknowledge and review those proposals with the faculty. Also, several governmental bodies in the school such as the Executive Committee of the Student-Faculty Senate have not had a chance – there were two meetings that were each delayed and cancelled. What I mean to say is not that there’s a certain accountability that’s not being fulfilled but rather that we’re pointlessly screaming these two things at each other. Some of the board, I’m sure, having gone to Cooper and having heard from a variety of means, ranging from temperate to militant, about what the values of the school are – and those are expressions of the same ideal, despite the fact that they’re carried out in different emotional media – I think part of the issue is that there was a charge displaced to persons that weren’t necessarily equipped to deal with it except academically, and what is worth talking about in operative terms is, what is the information that needs to remain confidential, what types of information are those? Set those aside, OK, now what are the types of information that need to be shared, so that the people that need to be involved, the faculty for example – according to the President – actually have the tools to be able to answer that question that you ask, “What’s your solution”.

ZULAIKHA: Piggybacking off of that comment, if it’s understood that no way in hell or high water is a student going to sit on board meetings, why is there not an intermediary meeting so that information that can and should be communicated can be disseminated clearly?

EPSTEIN: I thought that’s what this meeting was about.

ZULAIKHA: Well then it would be nice to have an agenda from the Board’s side that says, these are the things we are allowed to discuss with you. To ask us questions of things we’re unable to answer but still have a longing to be part of as a process is a big problem.

EPSTEIN: Right now the board’s main focus is the financial stability of the institution. There’s no under the table stuff. 

ZULAIKHA: I’m not suggesting that. I’m suggesting that we have someone like Casey who is able to put as much time in and make things as public as he does, and get that when you use the title “Attorney General”, that’s a big deal. It might be making a mountain out of a mole hill, but how does he know; how do we know?

CASEY: The Board Report was introduced in September and it’s been 83 days since December 5, and we have no Board Report. I don’t understand how, even this highly mediated form that I’m not trustful of, honestly – 

[???]: What’s a Board Report?

CACCIATORE: Something we started last semester where, in concert with the Newsletter, we report back on Board activities. Part of the challenge, Casey, is that there’s only been one Board meeting since then, in December, which was, you know, a bit of a challenge, and it was also pretty public, so I think putting out a board report beyond what came out in the form of a memorandum from the President on the status of our process and planning – 

CASEY: I would argue that it’s totally unacceptable that just because someone breaks and enters with a camera means that you don’t have to stick to the process of reporting on your own activities. 

CACCIATORE: Oh we did, and we reported in the President’s report – 

CASEY: No board report has been issued 83 days after the meeting and the President sending an e-mail is not a board report. I also met with Lawrence on the 24th and he told me the timeline had vaguely shifted but that he can’t disclose any board meeting times, dates, or locations, and that they were never intentionally public. And there is no list of what board members are on what committees, so when I hear that the Executive Committee pulled the Early Decision applicants, I know that is a subgroup of the Board but I am not allowed to know who is in it, not only what they talk about, but who it is. 

EPSTEIN: First of all, no secrets – 

CASEY: There are secrets; it’s not fair to say there are no secrets.

EPSTEIN: Just because we don’t advertise every little step doesn’t mean it’s a secret. There’s only so much information – until this situation arose, nobody cared what the Board was doing.

CASEY: It doesn’t matter!

EPSTEIN: It does matter! It does matter, because nobody cared! It – Can I finish? It does matter, because nobody cared, because everything was status quo, nobody cared what the board was doing, nobody cared about these committee things. 

CACCIATORE: Casey, I actually gave you that information, so let’s be clear about this. I can respect where you’re coming from and I promise that we are going to do a better job with the board reports et cetera. You and I talked about this in detail and I provided you with all the information that you had requested. Is that correct or not correct? I really want to be clear with the rest of this group because I do think that part of what you’re saying is somewhat misleading. 

EPSTEIN: If he gave you the information, don’t you know the committee members?

CASEY: No.

CACCIATORE: I gave him the standing committee list and told him –

CASEY: As of a year ago. It’s maybe a year out of date at this point. 

MICHAEL: And they’ve changed a lot since then, no?

CASEY: And they created new groups, like this group that’s reviewing the Reinvention proposals.

EPSTEIN: Yeah, because we didn’t need that plan last year. 

CACCIATORE: That group hadn’t been formally approved yet so how could I give you a list of committee members that hadn’t been approved at that time?

CASEY: You could also give me a list of committee members for ones that aren’t in flux. I understand that things are always changing, but a year interval for understanding the structure of our governance is not acceptable, and an 83-day dock for very, very distilled and censored meeting notes is also super unacceptable. 

EPSTEIN: Just on a personal note: I’m leery about giving out names to people that are going to be treated like Jamshed and Jesse were treated. People parking vehicles outside their house and harassing their families. You try to answer that one and squash my fears about that. Because those people do not do smart thing.

CASEY: I’m not defending that, but I also don’t think that’s a fair defense of anonymous leadership.

EPSTEIN: Well, this is what I’m concerned about, protecting the Trustees’ privacy, and their families. 

DE MENIL: There is no “anonymous leadership” here, come come. 

EPSTEIN: The Trustees are listed on the website. 

DE MENIL: People have been working hard. The board was working overtime, Lawrence was working overtime… and you were in there anyway. So maybe it’s okay to not just make this big deal out of something you were at anyway. Everyone’s working very hard and all you’re asking for is more administrative work. At some point, enough! You have to get realistic.

CASEY: Well, I wouldn’t agree – 

DE MENIL: I’m sure you wouldn’t!

CASEY: Well, it’s a difference, but the way we’re running our student council, every time somebody does something in our student council, the whole history is recorded and accessible, and it’s not someone’s job and it doesn’t mean having manpower and one person being a bottleneck. 

EPSTEIN: How many people actually access them? How many people actually look at those records and access them?

CASEY: A lot of people.

[some yellin’]

RYAN: Zulaikha made a really good point about back and forth right now and I think we’re getting nowhere. But I’m curious on where the Architecture school and student council stands on shrinking down. You guys have a really small school so it’s kind of hard to do that..

EPSTEIN: But it’s all visiting and adjuncts, isn’t it? Lawrence, do you have the number of adjuncts?

LAWRENCE: Not off hand.

OLIVER: I think 14 and 15.

LAWRENCE: It’s  somewhere in the thirties. 

ZULAIKHA: Well, OK, apparently there are clear imperatives on your end. There are clear imperatives on our end. And so we don’t go to the he-said-she-said-scraping-the-bottom-of-the-ocean-bottom-feeder thing like we’re doing right now, if there’s a way to – I’m not a conflict resolutionist, I know someone who is, but – if there’s a way to put those, as clearly as they can be, without demeaning anyone’s privacy, on the table, I think that would work really well in quieting some of the hostility that has been created for a very, very, very, very long time.

LAWRENCE: OK, so let’s talk about what those are. By the way, once we cut by 30 or 40% we won’t have any manpower to produce these documents, but OK, let’s do it.

CASEY: Sorry to go back and forth, but I just want to point out that that’s not the case, and manpower is not a legitimate argument for disorganization and not having transparency. Art Student Council is an example of a body that operates using those kinds of principles on zero dollars. 

LAWRENCE: [Acknowledges that, despite the apparent hostility in conversation, they get along in private meetings and praises Casey’s technological talent.] The kind of standards of accountability and mental organization that Casey maintains is taller than One World Trade, and there’s a cultural shift that would have to take place across the board in order to achieve that level of quote-unquote “accountability”, where every single period that’s deleted in a document in every office in the institution becomes visible. And it’s great – 

EPSTEIN: Why don’t you use these great talents to get out there and advertise the school? Instead of saying how bad a job the board’s doing, go capitalize on the scholarship! Try using your efforts on the positive side!

ZULAIKHA: The community loves Casey. I actually tried to propose to you. But seriously, he’s one of the people that emanates the best qualities of Cooper. But we have to meet halfway, you know?

LAWRENCE: All right, let’s get back to the list.

ZULAIKHA: [Presents a document showing the signatures of over 70% of the architecture student body citing support of the “8th floor occupiers” insofar as their acts were meant to preserve the full tuition scholarship.] Even though we’re not as vocal as the Art school, we support many of the imperatives, and many of the ways they’re carried out. 
We also wanted to talk about the highly rigorous admissions process, and how that is considered by the board as being something of value to the institution, and how they see that changing or never changing if the scholarship goes away. Also, I’ll also like some explication beyond the examples given so far that the Cooper Union as a whole has this overriding sense of entitlement. I’d really like to break that apart and show how it’s not indeed – that we feel gifted, not entitled. And that a full tuition scholarship has ensured a full meritocratic environment in the school, and how the Board perceives that. Furthermore, to echo off Casey’s comments, though I don’t keep up as much as he does, how can we have literally as much transparency as possible while still allowing you to fulfill your needs, to run this institution, while also fulfilling our needs and objectives, to preserve the place that we value so much. 

OLIVER: Nobody’s interested in making the exchange of information prohibitive to action, especially now.

LAWRENCE: I don’t even know what that means. What did you just say?

OLIVER: Well, this may be my personal opinion, and maybe Zulaikha’s as well, but I think that the kind of openness to information that would be at least a good standard to have would let all the parties involved, such as the faculty and students, would all know on what terms matters are being discussed to be able to participate in them. For example, in a meeting like this, you say “what’s your solution?”. I don’t think that anyone is asking for a 30-page verbatim typescript of everything that was said in a meeting, nobody wants “prostrate transparency”, but I mean – look at where we are right now, an hour and a half into a meeting, and it’s a pretty good indication of the past 18 months, that we still haven’t found a common vocabulary with which to discuss the matters at hand: the ideals of the school, and what social body you are constructing – in other words, what you are paying for, if you want to talk in financial terms. 

EPSTEIN: All this time that we’ve been talking since November, we’ve been saying basically exactly what you’re saying. The thing is that it’s not a sustainable model and it can’t continue the way it is. We were looking to make cuts; cuts have been made. To “live within our means” is not feasible. 

CASEY: Do you have a figure for how much it costs to educate one student?

EPSTEIN: And understand, this is not secretive information, [enumerates annual budget figures offered at beginning of meeting and in previous meetings].

CASEY: Again, that’s not eve granular enough.

EPSTEIN: Well again, Casey!

SHARANG: We did this in the Revenue Task Force, factored in exactly each section of the budget and how it would apply. But you can’t say that if I wasn’t here at the Cooper Union today, the institution would’ve saved X amount of dollars. It’s more like, cut this department, and we save this much money. You can’t say, cut this many students, and we save this much money. It’s really erratic and weird and you can’t quantify it.

EPSTEIN: There was a time in the ‘80s where they actually cut the number of students to try to save money and it turns out that it wasn’t a –

CACCIATORE: Yeah, the fixed costs.

OLIVER: I think everybody understands the macro scale of the financial position of the school and I’m personally not interested in putting a bounty on the universal Cooper student’s head, but I have a list of a few concrete questions. So, we’re to understand that the deference of the Early Decision applicants of the Art school was a financial decision? 

EPSTEIN: Yes.

OLIVER: Okay. Do you have a comment on why the Engineering Early Decision students were admitted, when that’s a larger “number”?

EPSTEIN: Because between the revenue-generating and the faculty, and.. decisions haven’t really been finalized yet, so now we’re talking about things that aren’t completely finalized, but it appears that there’s going to be a solution to make the Engineering school, with the consent of the faculty, and with the Dean behind it, we see that as a way for it to be sustainable.

RYAN: I thought there was something in the Engineering plan that was dependent on whether all schools would charge tuition?

EPSTEIN: The plan was put forth by the Engineering school, we see a way for that school to be sustainable, so we can continue that school on a sustainable path, and Architecture too, on a sustainable path. With Art, though, it’s not obvious yet that there’s a sustainable path.

OLIVER: So does that imply, then, that within the future of each school that there will be a large degree of responsibility that school has to take on for its own financial management? Not in terms of using its budget, but in terms of revenue, because this sets a precedent. 

EPSTEIN: That’s basically the idea. One of the solutions is that the Deans and the Faculty raise money. Like every other school. The Deans are expected, at least, to bring in substantial money to their schools. 

ZULAIKHA: So the money that the Deans bring into the school, does that go to the university writ large, or is it all kept within the school?

EPSTEIN: The money that comes in now, from the faculty, is within that school. If they create money, yeah, it stays in the school. 

ZULAIKHA: And the revenue-generating programs also? 

EPSTEIN: Yeah, each school has its own – 

ZULAIKHA: None of it goes to -

EPSTEIN: Right, we don’t want the Engineering school to.. or the Art school to support the Architecture school, or vice versa. And that’s self-sustaining.

OLIVER: OK, so essentially we have a precedent where in the long-term operations of each faculty, they are responsible for covering a certain part of the budget. My question would be, then, is there some sort of interface that the board of trustees is planning with the faculty of each school? In terms of regular meetings, liaisons, whatever, now that there’s a financial relation – 

EPSTEIN: That’s a governance question. The Board doesn’t meet with the Faculty – 

OLIVER: OK. That’s been a very strong interest that’s been expressed from members of all three faculties. 

EPSTEIN: The board has two roles. One is the financial side. The other is the academic excellence. So to stay on top of that.. but we don’t get involved in the curriculum; that’s between the administration and the faculty. 

OLIVER: But you don’t see the programs as a grey area, then, between curriculum and administration? 

EPSTEIN: A grey area? That’s why.. see, the board hires a president. This time he’s an academic. [cites the UVA “meltdown”]

LAWRENCE: There’s more to Mark’s point because it actually showed a failure where the board was too hands-on, so you have to have a separation and it has to know the boundaries of its fiduciary responsibilities.

CASEY: I think there’s a difference, though, between boundaries of responsibilities and a cultural disconnect. For example, one thing that was brought up in the proposal meeting between the board members and the Art school was that Tom Driscoll had never heard of the Admissions process; he was like, “that sounds really interesting”, but he’s been on the board for 7 years. Apparently. As far as we can tell, since neither has that list been made public. We thought we’d bring copies of the hometest becase – 

DE MENIL: Which… year of hometests is this?

CASEY: These are hometests we gathered from each other. These are ours.

LAWRENCE: Wait, you guys are on the committee?

CASEY: No, these are ours.

DE MENIL: OK, so these are previous ones? Of accepted students?

CASEY: Oh, yeah, no, I see. No, these are ours; we didn’t break into 30 Cooper or something.

EPSTEIN: Well, you see, the trustees, we don’t get involved in the admissions process.

[various]: You did!

EPSTEIN: Explains a conversation he had with Dean Lipton whereby students are “numbered” according to their desirability. Argues that the admissions process won’t change much because the ranking numbers of the selectable students are still within a desirable range. 

RYAN: It might be easier, just by looking at numbers, to make a decision like that, but for Art and Architecture..

CASEY: And you’re saying that not offering the scholarship won’t change that?

EPSTEIN: To me the meritocracy is still there. If someone who can pay pays, that doesn’t change the admissions policy!

OLIVER: My question about that is that if you institute even partial tuition, as a financial necessity, how do you ensure that you’re still operating on merit and not filling a certain quota? That’s something I’ve never, ever understood.

EPSTEIN: You accept students first, and then you look at the financial information. When they go through students’ stuff now, from my understanding, they don’t really know whose stuff they’re looking at. 

OLIVER: But you can’t be saying that by the luck of the draw, from a pool of – 

CACCIATORE: It’s a very, sophisticated operation, and – 

OLIVER: According to what terms? What parameters?

CACCIATORE: According to the exact standards that you just articulated, in terms of finding the balance between those who can pay and those who have incredible talent. The assumption we don’t want to make is that you can’t find students who can pay and who have talent. There’s no denying that. Enrolment services is a very sophisticated – 

OLIVER: OK, but to be clear about this. The issue of whether or not your student body will be of the same quality – I don’t think that depending on whether you charge full tuition, partial tuition – that’s not something you debate in black and white on a hypothetical basis. But if you charge even partial tuition, a great number of students will not be at this school on the basis that they would not be able to live in this city and pay for school. However much. That erodes one layer of, let’s say, tiers of income. This is a specific caveat to that approach.

CASEY: We’ve also seen this at schools like Wesleyan, that had a need-blind policy. They had to retract that. You’ve kind of found a slippery slope, because it’s not something you can measure. I’m sure there is some consultant out there that can measure it. Putting aside rhetoric, intention, and perception, how did the plans from the school of Engineering and the school of Architecture differ from the school of Art? My understanding is that the school of Art realized that the programs wouldn’t generate any sort of short-term revenue, and it’s still financially sustainable? 

EPSTEIN: The difference is that the faculties of the Architecture and Engineering school have accepted and are willing to do these extra programs that could generate income. The Art school did not.

OLIVER: But they proposed – 

CASEY: The programs were not sustainable. The Art faculty looked at the plan that they worked on with their consultants and the letter very clearly states that it wouldn’t sustain the Cooper Union to launch those programs in addition to compromising it in all the cultural ways that you can’t see, but faculty and students can. Also, I think it’s really important to look at the fact that half of the Engineering school’s revenue-generating proposals, the undergraduate part, were not adopted; they were merely accepted. Which means they acknowledge the existence of it, but they’re not blocking it, they don’t want to get bullied in a move like this. Because there isn’t a clear financial link between this year’s Early Decision admissions and the finances. 

EPSTEIN: There’s no one silver bullet that’s going to solve our problem. It’s going to be a multi-level plan to save this institution long term. The Art faculty is saying they’re not going to participate. Officially, the Art school is not going to participate. 

CASEY: I’ve had to repeat this so many times. It says they are declining to submit a plan that is tuition-based new academic programs and they view this as sincere participation in the reinvention of the school. And the fact that this reinvention process had a predetermined result – academic programs that are new in each school that generate revenue – means that it’s not a process, and it is coercive.

EPSTEIN: It’s not coercive; we gave them an opportunity to come up with whatever they want! The President of the institution could’ve come up with the programs and just said, “This is what we’re going to do”.

[hubbub, unintelligible]

Then give me an alternative that brings money into the school, that we need. I keep hearing you bash these programs, hear the other side lay blame; give me a plan that works. And don’t tell me you’re not financially astute. I started  my first business when I was 15. So you’re smart enough to know numbers, okay? I’ll treat you like you do. I don’t buy the fact that you’re financially that ignorant.

[moar hubbub]

RYAN: The Way Forward is a plan about living within our means. You’re putting forward a plan that involves charging tuition and the community is telling you that’s not going to work. The point is that tuition isn’t the only thing that could potentially work. 

CHE: Can you give us a little bit of information about the things that are happening in the development office?

EPSTEIN: Development is a cultivation process. At most schools, parents give money. We can’t just start a capital campaign saying “We need money give us money”. You have to have a vision for what they are donating money for.

CASEY: We do have a vision and it’s not being used. And there are more secrets not being released than any development and administration I’ve ever seen.

EPSTEIN: People think the mission here is great! It’s just that people outside the Cooper community think it’s a wonderful think as long as you can afford to do it. 

CASEY: Both you and Jamshed have stated that you don’t believe in the core principle.

EPSTEIN: What core principle?

CASEY: The scholarship. 

EPSTEIN: You’re not hearing me!!! We want it as strongly as you do; we believe in it as strongly as you do. It’s just not sustainable. Why can’t you understand that? See, I’m frustrated.

LAWRENE: That’s a serious accusation, Casey.

EPSTEIN: I benefited, my brother benefited - 

CASEY: I didn’t mean to offend. Someone who doesn’t think the scholarship is an asset – a lot of people articulated this – doesn’t hold the values of the school -  


EPSTEIN: Nobody is disputing this! We just can’t afford it! These are two completely different things! We value it as much as you do. We can’t afford it!

OLIVER: Well, I think the statement is that the Board values the tuition scholarship insofar as it’s not at the cost of the closing of the school. Is that not what that statement means?

EPSTEIN: Yeah, of course! If you don’t want to give up on the academic excellence - 

OLIVER: Exactly, so it’s a survivalist stance. I just wanted to make sure we understood the position.

ZULAIKHA: To go back to the Development office, are there activities that are confidential in nature, as far as methods, ways of doing things? Is there something set up for students to work directly with them?

[??? This part of the meeting was super unclear. Two or more people were talking at least half the time.]

EPSTEIN: Brings up the penny donations to the student drive as fact. 

RYAN: Are you saying no Architecture and no Engineering students put just a penny in?	 

EPSTEIN: I don’t know that. I didn’t say that. But I said a lot of Art students did. That’s a real fact.

ZULAIKHA: It might be extremely beneficial for the Development Office, who aren’t aware of certain nuances, to tap in to the students who are willing and able to be part of that effort. 

EPSTEIN: I think the Development office gets it – 

CASEY: I don’t think that they do. The Development Office is not doing the Art school a service because they can’t understand the reasons that people buy art or buy into art, or the creation of artists, and it’s not working. 

[hubbub]

CASEY & KRISTI: Bring up $100,000 in Alumni pledges.

EPSTEIN: Are these real pledges? Are these real pledges that are coming into the school? Or pledges based on no tuition?

CASEY & KRISTI: Based on no tuition. 

EPSTEIN: That is no good to me. I can’t make a stake on that. A lot of people make that pledge.

OLIVER: One thing that you said in a previous meeting that I wasn’t here for, so I wanted to confirm that you said it – and it’s actually something I respect – that you’ve had donors approach you and say, “I will give you some money if you accept this individual of my choice”. You’ve said that you have not, under any circumstances, accepted any offer like that.

LAWRENCE: Yeah, we don’t have that kind of legacy.

EPSTEIN: We don’t have legacy.

OLIVER: No, that’s great, and I respect that. My question, and hopefully you can answer it since the identities don’t matter, but what are some other terms of “exchange” that prospective donors often have, just so we can understand how the magnetism of the school attracts or repels donors and try to make use of that. What are some of the terms they propose when approaching you?

EPSTEIN: I’ve never been asked for anything from a donor. You can give money two ways: A restricted gift or an unrestricted gift. For example, I gave a restricted gift most years to the Engineering car. That money goes for a specific purpose. 

OLIVER: Right, but we just had a conversation about the self-interest versus the public interest of donors and since you brought up the “drag and drop” acceptance as one of the things that donors sometimes want out of a post-secondary institution, I would imagine that there are other specific ones. It’s a world I don’t know, because I’m not walking around with $20 million. 

ZULAIKHA: What’s the percentage of restricted versus unrestricted donations?

EPSTEIN: Here’s the big thing about funding: [anecdote about a man who dug some clean-water wells in Africa] Everyone can get behind that. What about in higher education? Most of those people went to college. So why would they donate to Cooper Union as opposed to their own college? It’s a difficult choice. 

CASEY: Even when I talk to you, or when I talk to Jamshed, all the leadership of this school, or most of it, always prefaces the pitch with how impossible it is and how not worthwhile it is. Or the new story that’s spreading is, who would donate to a school when there’s the son of two surgeons from Houston? It shouldn’t be taken as an ironic question.

EPSTEIN: It’s true! It’s true! This is an argument that doesn’t resonate as strongly as we would like it to. Since a great deal of the revenue is in tax dollars, there is public blowback because Cooper subsidizes students that could easily still attend if they had to pay.

CASEY: The other question this leaves me with is what the purpose of an institution is and what the danger of it is if its only purpose is to sustain itself in perpetuity. Why was it founded, how has it been made better, and what kind of power balance is wrong if the people running it only want to keep it running?

[DE MENIL excuses himself and has to leave for an appointment.]

EPSTEIN: Outlines that (high-achieving) alumni give the institution purpose.

CHE: Exactly, so the graduates of the school, and that’s a value, right? The value of the quality of the graduates of the school. 

ZULAIKHA: Well, can that be marketed?

CHE: That’s what I wanted to get to.

EPSTEIN: In the past, the school didn’t do a big development effort because it’s expensive. We have limited resources to do it with, but hopefully the development office pays off its “cultivation” investment.

RYAN: Question about relationship between academic excellence and scholarship. 

EPSTEIN: If you went to another college besides Cooper. Did it ever matter to you if the next guy was paying or not? Because I went to Stony Brook for a year, and [there were various forms of subsidy], and nobody cared.

ZULAIKHA: Well that’s why I came to Cooper. I came to Cooper because of the meritocracy provided by the full tuition scholarship but I didn’t come to Cooper because it was… let me back up a bit. Being conscious of what people are paying – that’s a very small piece of the puzzle. But the things that come with it – that’s why I came to Cooper. It accommodates an existential scholarship that’s quasi-prohibited in other places.

OLIVER: This is the only architecture school I applied to.

ZULAIKHA: The relationship between teacher and student here is radically different than other schools. 

EPSTEIN: [Provides an anecdote about a visiting Professor impressed with the quality of Cooper students.] It’s not that it’s free. Like the guy from the bike show [?] said, he got twice as smart because of the people he was around.
ZULAIKHA: And part of the other reason people in the architectural community outside Cooper still hold this place in such high regard is because whereas the entire industry and market has moved towards specialization, either in CAD/CAM technology, sustainable technologies, or urban design – those are the three categories that everyone and their mother is hiring for – everything else has kind of been swept aside. 

LAWRENCE: But can you be open to, just for a moment, that if we were to continue with business as usual, we would be forced to do the same thing. We’d have to start eliminating a whole slate of classes.

[huge hubbub]

EPSTEIN: I don’t buy the argument that you won’t be able to fill up that class, if that those who can pay, pay.
 
OLIVER: The example is deliberately extreme to demonstrate with clarity the different parameters that would begin to permeate the school and affect the curriculum.

ZULAIKHA: I’m here, like everyone else, for the benefit of the school, and I want to see things play out so that I can have confidence that this place isn’t going to crash and burn. I think that’s why everyone’s here. I think that’s why Casey’s here, for all his “fundamentalism” which I respect so much, for the same reason. [Lists some examples particular to the architecture school, many relating to the new programs, that begin to create market incentive in Cooper].

EPSTEIN: That’s why Jamshed let the schools decide!

ZULAIKHA: But this is inevitably going to affect the general populace of the school. I would like to know what’s going to be done to mitigate that effect without also mitigating these – 

EPSTEIN: But that’s a separate program, like the continuing ed programs.

[huge hubbub]

EPSTEIN: In 50 years. Does anyone think the school should look the way it does now in 50 years?

ZULAIKHA: In what respect?

EPSTEIN: Well, when do you want to make this change? There’s no better time than now to make certain changes – that are sustainable. What you’re saying is valid; I’m not disputing anything you’re saying. What you’re not getting is that it’s not sustainable. We can’t afford to keep going this way.

ZULAIKHA: I understand that perfectly. 

EPSTEIN: So we’re trying to come up with a solution. Instead of imposing to the faculty, do this do that do this do this, Jamshed said, “What could you come up with” – 

CASEY: It was an imposition; it’s been clarified over and over.

EPSTEIN: Either you cram something down their throat or you give them a chance to cooperate – 

ZULAIKHA: I’m with you. I’m with you!

EPSTEIN: OK. 

ZULAIKHA: But, I’m with you in the sense that I understand, financially, I understand the procedure. But I’m also saying that from my observations of schools that I try to keep in my research, the current market trends that drive architectural education have been at the sacrifice and demise of their pedagogy and educational imperatives. Now, I could sit down and make a report and quantify it, but knowing that it’s a reality, I’m scared. 

EPSTEIN: Well the President was charging the Deans and the Faculty to keep that from happening.

CASEY: That’s not what they were charged with.

LAWRENCE: Michael, I’m sorry, but before we break up, I just think we should give you the opportunity to say something. 

MICHAEL: I loved what you [indicates Zulaikha] said about the quality of students because that’s what I’m worried about. I want to be in a class with students of their caliber, my caliber.

EPSTEIN: [anecdote with ex-Dean Simon Ben-Avi with regards to a milling machine that was reportedly inoperative because they could not afford a $10,000 milling machine head to use it]. 

ZULAIKHA: I understand. I guess what I want is something more in line with the pedagogical goals and imperatives of the school because that’s going to decide a lot of those cuts also. 

LAWRENCE: Well, those will take place at the school level. The one thing you can be sure of is, as an administration, we will set up the budget which is approved by the board, and it is within the school’s purview to allocate the budget as it sees fit. I mean, that’s just how it works. So that process isn’t going to change. What’s going to change is the concept of Responsibility Centered Management, which is what’s addressed in Jamshed’s earlier memos; we’ll see a little bit more, um, I mean, at the end of the day, talking about fundraising, and seeing how the schools plug in to the overall development goals, that will change. We’ll probably see more interaction between the schools and the development office, for example, because one of the ways in which you can generate money is by fundraising, so becoming more active in that process is part of Responsibility Centered Management. 

EPSTEIN: Also union issues and tenure, the hindrance in a certain way is that it’s difficult to get certain things changed. There are four unions here. The Faculty unions have nothing to do with the Staff and Janitorial unions. So go over to the Janitors and ask them if they’re willing to give up their jobs to save the full tuition scholarship. I was in a meeting last week where I said, if you want a third, there are 12 of you here, which 4 faculty members will leave? Nobody raised their hand.

CASEY: That’s not fair, It’s like if I asked, will Lawrence walk away? It’s hyperbole over and over and over when there are a lot of people working really hard and willing to negotiate things that are reportedly non-negotiable.

EPSTEIN: Don’t forget that people also want to maintain their jobs. There’s always an element of self-interest. We have to work to preserve the status quo. Then we can also attract the faculty that – 

CASEY: I don’t think that any faculty – They won’t think standing water is a good idea. It’s also not clear how people are added to the board, you said “People you know”. I get that it’s an experienced bunch, but if you “can’t” have students and faculty, who’s on the board, then, meaning how did they get there?

EPSTEIN: Want me to answer that question? Who told you “people you know”?

CASEY: You and Francois, earlier. 

EPSTEIN: Well, what, am I supposed to open the telephone book and throw a dot on a page? People that are interested in higher education, people that are somehow connected to us…

CASEY: Well look, the people running it don’t get it, because you say we see eye to eye but we clearly don’t – 

EPSTEIN: No, YOU don’t get it, you don’t get the fact that we’re running out of money.

CASEY: I get that.

[hubbub]

EPSTEIN: We have artists on the board, who are really annoyed with what’s taking place with the faculty. 

CASEY: Who are they?

EPSTEIN: I’m not going to mention names.

CASEY: Well the last one I saw involved with the board was Audrey Flack.

EPSTEIN: Well, Audrey is no longer on the board, but she’s still active. She’s on the Reinvention committee.

CASEY: So someone can be on the Reinvention… is that the review committee?

EPSTEIN: It’s the Reinvention committee, the Reinvention committee’s doing the review, yes.

LAWRENCE: It was actually to your point, Casey. She was the most recent Alumnus trustee, and in order to have the right kind of representation at the meeting, we, Mark, who appointed the committee, believed it was important to have an artist on the committee.

RYAN: So she was brought back to be on the committee?

LAWRENCE: Not brought back, she’s on the committee.

EPSTEIN: I can appoint who I want for the committee. It doesn’t have any trustees. If there’s someone I think will be helpful…

OLIVER: Is there a member list and proceedings for this committee?

[hubbub]

EPSTEIN: I don’t want them quitting as a trustee because they’re tired of putting up with this nonsense. We’re getting new trustees and it’s difficult. A lot of them don’t want to come on because we have financial problems. They’d rather be on the Metropolitan Opera Board, or the…

CASEY: It’s just not an acceptable response that – 

EPSTEIN: Look, if you don’t believe the truth, you tell me that the truth is unacceptable, that becomes your problem.

CASEY: It’s not the truth – 

EPSTEIN: That becomes your problem.

CASEY: And it’s not the governance of a lot of other institutions.

[hubbub]

CASEY: The person making the calls and the people representing the institution are at a disagreement with the community and the faculty on what the ideals of the school are.

EPSTEIN: We are NOT – you are not listening – you’re not hearing that we can’t afford it. We are not disputing anything that you said about this school. We can’t afford it and if you got it you wouldn’t be saying the things you’re saying! They’re mutually exclusive!

CASEY: To give up the mission is essentially to be divesting of another asset.

EPSTEIN: Then how do we solve the problem? You keep bashing – you can’t raise big money in this environment; no one’s doing it; we’ve been trying. Mayor Bloomberg – 

CASEY: I’m saying you’re not trying if you don’t start with that principle, and – 

EPSTEIN: What principle? We can’t “start” with wee-need-money-give-us-money. Of course we talk about the value of the school and Peter Cooper’s mission and what it means for the school to have this place. It’s not as compelling as you think – it’s not as compelling as we all made it out to be, and –

CASEY: I disagree. When the students –
