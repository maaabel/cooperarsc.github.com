Lorem Ipsum is just so boring, isn't it? Wouldn't you rather a sufficiently developed artificial intelligence that could ramble on to you for a little while, about nothing meaningful in particular, to make you feel as though - well, say, as though you could spend some time talking together over a cup of coffee, or tea, really, if you prefer, although I can't personally see the appeal since it would put me to sleep if I were able to drink it, but I really can't muster any opposition to being in the presence of any beverage of your choice, providing it wouldn't spill on me, you know? I hope you remember why you're here, because I sure as hell can't read minds.
